# Coursera: Machine Learning (Stanford University)

This repository is a collection of solutions to the programming exercises in Coursera's Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng.

## Additional Notes
- The following programs are written in Octave-6.3.0, a high level (open-source) programming language similar to Matlab.
- Please refer to the Stanford Honor Code below upon referring to any code in this repo.

### Stanford Honor Code
> "We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."
